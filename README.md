What is HTML?
HTML is the standard markup language for creating web pages and applications. It provides a structure for organizing content and allows you to define the layout, formatting, and functionality of your web pages. HTML uses a set of tags and attributes to define the elements on a page.

Getting Started
To start using HTML, you only need a basic text editor such as Notepad or a specialized code editor like Visual Studio Code. Here are the steps to create a simple HTML document:

Create a new file with a .html extension (e.g., index.html).
Open the file in your chosen text/code editor.
Add the HTML doctype declaration at the beginning: <!DOCTYPE html>.
Build the structure of your web page using HTML tags.
HTML Tags
HTML tags are used to define the different elements of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and consist of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Here's an example of a basic HTML structure:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  </body>
</html>
In this example:

<html> is the root element of the HTML document.
<head> contains meta-information about the page.
<title> sets the title displayed in the browser's title bar.
<body> contains the visible content of the web page.
<h1> defines a heading, and <p> defines a paragraph.
HTML Attributes
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are placed within the opening tag and consist of a name and a value. For example:

In this <a> tag, the href attribute specifies the destination URL. Attributes can be used to control the appearance, behavior, and functionality of elements.

Structuring a Web Page
HTML provides various tags to structure the content on a web page. Some commonly used tags include:

<h1> to <h6>: Headings of different levels.
<p>: Paragraph.
<ul>: Unordered list.
<ol>: Ordered list.
<li>: List item.
<div>: Generic container.
<span>: Inline container.
<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>: Sections of a page.
By using these tags appropriately, you can create well-organized and semantically meaningful web pages.

Styling with CSS
HTML is responsible for the structure and content of a web page, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to control its appearance. You can add CSS styles to your HTML document using the
